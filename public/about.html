<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Honoured with the Best Design Collection Award issued by the department of fashion and lifestyle, Karnavati University in April 2024 for my Graduation Project. Selected to showcase the collection at Ahmedabad Fashion Week, 2024.</p>

<p>Completed A Levels (2020) at Sancta Maria International School. Courses including Art and Design, English Language, Economics and Business have helped me develop a wholesome knowledge about research and design in the industry.</p>

<p>Being a sub-editor on my high school’s newsletter was also an imperative experience to hone my skills and develop a passion for writing. I was also the head of the makeup team on my university’s fashion society, this gave me the opportunity to lead my team and create as well as execute the process of building a look and bringing it down the runway.</p> 

<p>I have also collaborated with brands like SUGAR Cosmetics and been featured in the Allure Magazine. These experiences have given me the opportunity to understand and work in the industry.</p>

<p>I am a maximalist and I celebrate colours. I use my sense of colour theory in my makeup and face painting. Moreover, | enjoy creating surrealistic and otherworldly characters through illustration. I also enjoy creating prints and compositions.</p>
